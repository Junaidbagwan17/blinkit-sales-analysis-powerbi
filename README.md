I created this project to **understand Blinkit’s sales data**, explore **how their selling works across different regions**, and analyze **which outlet tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)** generate the most profit and sales.  
This dashboard helps break down their business performance using clear visual analytics.
